# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Player

A rule-based AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe optimally.

## How it works
- Uses strategic rules to make moves
- Prioritizes winning, then blocking, then center, corners, and edges
- Written in Python with a single `play()` function

## Usage
The `play()` function takes a board array and returns the next move position (0-8).
